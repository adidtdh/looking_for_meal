# Looking For Meal

An app that helps you find friends to eat with on college campuses

---

## Problem

Sometimes you have to text in your 5 group chats "is anyone at the dining hall". This app solves that problem by matching you with your friends.

## Audience

This app is made for college students who want to eat with people at the dining hall.

## Purpose

The purpose of this app is to connect people at the dining hall with each other so people do not have to eat a meal along. The app will act somewhat as an semi automated dating app that matches people with their friends, and in the case that there are no friends, based on their preferences.

# Project

## Description

- MERN tech stack

Users are first greeted by a login page where they can login. Upon sighup, they would have selected their university. They can also edit their profile which has 3 simple questions.

1. Do you only want to eat with your friends or are you
2. Do you want to talk or do you want to listen?
3. WIP

The system then matches two people. Users also have the option to friend other people by their username and friends are given first preference for matches.

## Timeline

This project will take 1 week to make, from the 20th of May to the 25th of May. Below is an enumerated list with all the tasks I must do. The project gets more finished as time goes on but the first goal is to get a working project.

- Have the users be able to enter a username and store this username in the database
- Make a "Find Table" button that makes a "table"
- As another compatible person joins, add the person to the "table" and share their username
- Let users leave the table

At this point, this project should be minimally functional.

- Add password based login
- Add the 3 questions and a "compatibility score" and "compatibility threshold"
- Add to the users profile by adding a phone number and their name
- Let users change their profile
- Let users add friends that have a max compatibility score and are matched first
- Let users see if their friends are at the dining hall and force enter their tables
- Make the interface look nice

At this point, this project should be functional to an acceptable level

# First project disclaminer

This was my first time using javascript, express, html, css, node, react, mongodb, and almost everything else you see in this project. As a result, parts of this project are really poorly done. Given the time requirement and my need to both learn tech stack and write the code, I did not go back and fix the broken code as I learned more. On my next project, I will use my new knowledge to make a better project
